The source code for my personal website, available at [arturmyszkowski.pl](https://arturmyszkowski.pl).

This project was created to serve as a digital business card, and in the future a place to showcase my most interesting projects, and a platform for writing technical articles.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started: Local Development

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh

    This theme is included as a Git submodule. You must run this command to download it.

## üíÑ Favicon

The favicon set for this website was generated using the excellent tool [RealFaviconGenerator.net](https://realfavicongenerator.net/). This service was used to create a comprehensive set of icons, ensuring correct and high-quality display on all major browsers and platforms, including:

*   Standard browser tabs (`favicon.ico`, PNG versions)
*   Apple touch icons for iOS (`apple-touch-icon.png`)
*   Android Chrome home screen icons
*   Pinned tab icons for Safari (SVG)
*   Windows Metro tiles

The generated files are located in the `static/` directory, and the necessary HTML link tags have been added to the site's `<head>` via a custom `layouts/partials/extended_head.html` partial, which is a standard Hugo and PaperMod theme practice for this type of customization.
