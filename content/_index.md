Hi! I am a **Senior Software Developer** with over seven years of experience, holding a Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Warsaw. In my previous role, I focused on **creating modern front-end applications** with a strong emphasis on high interactivity and performance. I believe that an essential skill for a developer is not just mastering a single tool, but the ability to efficiently learn and apply the best technology for the task at hand.
